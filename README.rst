================
graph_matching_p
================


    Python package with Graph Matching (GM) methods.


Code with methods for reproducing the results in paper "Seeded graph matching for the correlated Wigner model via the projected power method",arXiv:2204.04099. 

Contains:
-GM methods = Projected Power Methods and other more classic methods for seedless graph matching.

-GM generative models = models for generating correlated graphs (matrices), according to the correlated Gaussian Wigner, correlated Erdos-Renyi, correlated Random Geometric graphs models. 

-aux methods = several useful functions. 

-Python Notebooks with (minimal) examples of use.
